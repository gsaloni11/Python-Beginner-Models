### Hacker Statistics
    This model predics the chances of winning the bet that says if you throw a dice 100 times.
    If it is 1 or 2, you go 1 step down, if it is 3,4,5 , you go 1 step up and if it is 6, you throw the dice again and walk up the resulting steps(1,2,3,4,5,6). 
    You cannot go below step 0 and have a 0.1% chance of falling down and if it happens u start over from step 0. 
    You win thw bet if you reach higher than step 60.
